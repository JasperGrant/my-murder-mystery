# my-murder-mystery
A Detective game where you as the detective will have to find the murderer in a mystery written by ChatGPT. 
A CLI Game made in 3 hours for the lifelike hackathon. Buggy but fun!

## Setup
1. Clone project from ``` https://github.com/JasperGrant/my-murder-mystery.git ```
2. Run ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
3. Create a .env file and insert the line ``` OPENAI_API_KEY= {Your OpenAI Key} ```
4. Run ``` python main.py ```

## Background info
This project was a really fun one. I spent probably 15 hours getting annoyed by setting up graphical interfaces and then at the very ended wrote this CLI game in 3 hours.

### Disclaimer
- ChatGPT is sometimes weird with it's formatting which may cause weird errors I am not ready for.
- I did not implement very good error handling so type 0 1 or 2 to select characters.
- The NPCs are super reluctant to admit they are the murderer. Sometimes they will be the murderer and give no indication.
